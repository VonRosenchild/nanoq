    abstract = {FASTA and FASTQ are basic and ubiquitous formats for storing nucleotide and protein sequences. Common manipulations of FASTA/Q file include converting, searching, filtering, deduplication, splitting, shuffling, and sampling. Existing tools only implement some of these manipulations, and not particularly efficiently, and some are only available for certain operating systems. Furthermore, the complicated installation process of required packages and running environments can render these programs less user friendly. This paper describes a cross-platform ultrafast comprehensive toolkit for FASTA/Q processing. SeqKit provides executable binary files for all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX, and can be directly used without any dependencies or pre-configurations. SeqKit demonstrates competitive performance in execution time and memory usage compared to similar tools. The efficiency and usability of SeqKit enable researchers to rapidly accomplish common FASTA/Q file manipulations. SeqKit is open source and available on Github at https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit.},

  abstract = "Long sequencing reads are information-rich: aiding de novo
              assembly and reference mapping, and consequently have great
              potential for the study of microbial communities. However, the
              best approaches for analysis of long-read metagenomic data are
              unknown. Additionally, rigorous evaluation of bioinformatics
              tools is hindered by a lack of long-read data from validated
              samples with known composition.We sequenced 2 commercially
              available mock communities containing 10 microbial species
              (ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standards) with Oxford Nanopore
              GridION and PromethION. Both communities and the 10 individual
              species isolates were also sequenced with Illumina technology. We
              generated 14 and 16 gigabase pairs from 2 GridION flowcells and
              150 and 153 gigabase pairs from 2 PromethION flowcells for the
              evenly distributed and log-distributed communities, respectively.
              Read length N50 ranged between 5.3 and 5.4 kilobase pairs over
              the 4 sequencing runs. Basecalls and corresponding signal data
              are made available (4.2 TB in total). Alignment to
              Illumina-sequenced isolates demonstrated the expected microbial
              species at anticipated abundances, with the limit of detection
              for the lowest abundance species below 50 cells (GridION). De
              novo assembly of metagenomes recovered long contiguous sequences
              without the need for pre-processing techniques such as binning.We
              present ultra-deep, long-read nanopore datasets from a
              well-defined mock community. These datasets will be useful for
              those developing bioinformatics methods for long-read
              metagenomics and for the validation and comparison of current
              laboratory and software pipelines.",
