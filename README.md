## Motivation

Basic read filters and computation of summary statistics can be a bit slow when a `sequencing_summary` file is not available. `Nanoq` attempts to perform these operations on `fastq` files a little faster.

## Usage

```
nanoq --fastq test.fq --length 1000 --quality 10 --output filt.fq 
```

`Nanoq` outputs a single row of whitespace delimited numerics for the summary statistics of the `fastq` file to `stderr`:

```
29082396 5000 62483 120 5816 2898 11.87 12.02
```

These correspond to:

```
bp_total num_reads longest_reads shortest_read mean_length median_length mean_q median_q
```

Please note that `nanoq` is not a general `fastq` quality control tool because the quality scores are computed for basecalls from nanopore sequencing data as outlined in the [technical documentation](https://community.nanoporetech.com/technical_documents/data-analysis/) and [this issue](https://github.com/esteinig/nanoq/issues/2).

## Etymology

Since all the 'qc' variants of nanopore-themed names seemed to be taken the 'c' was rather lazily dropped. Coincidentally `nanoq` [nan…îq] also means 'polar bear' in Native American (Eskimo-Aleut, Greenlandic). If you find `nanoq` useful for your research consider a small donation to the [Polar Bear Fund](https://www.polarbearfund.ca/) or [Polar Bears International](https://polarbearsinternational.org/).
