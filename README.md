## Purpose

Basic sequence quality control and computation of summary statistics can be a bit slow due to bottlenecks in read parsing. `Nanoq` attempts to perform these operations on `fastx` files using the `needletail` and `rust-bio` libraries with either a single-pass operation for defaulty summary statistics and filtering, or a two-pass operation enabling advanced filtering methods similar to `Filtlong`.

Quality scores are computed for basecalls from nanopore sequencing data, as outlined in the [technical documentation](https://community.nanoporetech.com/technical_documents/data-analysis/).

## Install

### `Cargo`

If you have [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and `Cargo` installed:

```
cargo install nanoq
```

### `Conda`

Currently on this channel but will be in `BioConda`:

```
conda install -c esteinig nanoq
nanoq --help
```


### `Docker`

`Docker` container is based on the light `Alpine` OS (~ 28 MB container size)

```
docker pull esteinig/nanoq:latest
```

#### `Singularity`

```
singularity pull docker://esteinig/nanoq:latest
```


## Usage

Tests can be run within the `nanoq` repository:

```
cargo test
```

`Nanoq` accepts a file or stream of sequence reads in `fast{a/q}` and compressed formats on `stdin`:

```bash
cat test.fq | nanoq
```

Basic summary statistics are output to `stderr`: 

```bash
100000 400398234 5154 44888 5 4003 3256 8.90 9.49
```

* number of reads
* number of base pairs
* N50 read length
* longest and shorted reads
* mean and median read length
* mean and median read quality 

Extended output analogous to `NanoStat` can be obtained using multiple `--detail` flags:

```bash
cat test.fq | nanoq -d -d -d
```

Reads filtered by minimum read length (`--length`) and mean read quality (`--quality`) are output to `stdout`:

```bash
cat test.fq | nanoq -l 1000 -q 10 > reads.fq 
```

Advanced two-pass filtering analogous to `Filtlong` removes the worst 20% of bases using sorted reads by quality (`--keep_percent`) or the worst quality reads until approximately 500 Mbp remain (`--keep_bases`): 

```bash
nanoq -f test.fq -p 80 -b 500000000  > reads.fq 
```

Live sequencing run data directory:

```bash
RUN=/data/nanopore/run
```

Check total run statistics of active run:

```bash
find $RUN -name *.fastq -print0 | xargs -0 cat | nanoq
```

Check per-barcode statistics of active run:

```bash
for i in {01..12}; do
  find $RUN -name barcode${i}.fastq -print0 | xargs -0 cat | nanoq
done
```

### Parameters

```
nanoq 0.2.0

Fast quality control and summary statistics for nanopore reads

USAGE:
    nanoq [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -c, --crab       Rust-Bio parser (fastq only) [false]
    -d, --detail     Print detailed read summary [false]
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -f, --fastx <FASTX>             Fastx input file [-]
    -o, --output <OUTPUT>           Fastx output file [-]
    -m, --max_length <MAXLEN>       Maximum sequence length [0]
    -l, --min_length <MINLEN>       Minimum sequence length [0]
    -q, --min_quality <QUALITY>     Minimum average sequence quality [0]
    -b, --keep_bases <BASES>        Keep reads with best quality number of bases [0]
    -p, --keep_percent <PERCENT>    Keep best percent quality bases on reads [0]
    -t, --top <TOP>                 Print <top> length + quality reads [5]
```

### Output

`Nanoq` outputs  reads to `/dev/stdout` or a `fastq` file. If filters are switched off (default) only the summary statistics are computed. `Nanoq` outputs a single row of summary statistics on the filtered read set to `/dev/stderr`:

```
5000 29082396 62483 120 5816 2898 11.87 12.02
```

These correspond to:

```
reads bp longest shortest mean_length median_length mean_qscore median_qscore
```

Extended output is enabled with up to 3 `--detail` (`-d`) flags:

```
nanoq -f test.fq -d -d
```

```

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks evaluate processing speed of a long-read filter and computation of summary statistics on the first 100,000 reads (`test.fq.gz` in Docker container) of the even [Zymo mock community](https://github.com/LomanLab/mockcommunity) (`GridION`) using the `nanoq:v0.2.0` [`Benchmark`](paper/Benchmarks) image with comparison to [`NanoFilt`](https://github.com/wdecoster/nanofilt), [`NanoStat`](https://github.com/wdecoster/nanostat) and [`Filtlong`](https://github.com/rrwick/Filtlong)

## Dependencies

`Nanoq` uses [`rust-bio`](https://rust-bio.github.io/) which has a ton of great contributors and the [`needletail`](https://github.com/onecodex/needletail) library from OneCodex. 

## Etymology

Avoided name collision with `nanoqc` and dropped the `c` to arrive at `nanoq` [nan…îq] which coincidentally means 'polar bear' in Native American ([Eskimo-Aleut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskimo%E2%80%93Aleut_languages), Greenlandic). If you find `nanoq` useful for your research consider a small donation to the [Polar Bear Fund](https://www.polarbearfund.ca/) or [Polar Bears International](https://polarbearsinternational.org/)
