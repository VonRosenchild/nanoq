## Motivation

Basic read filters and computation of summary statistics can be a bit slow when a `sequencing_summary` file is not available. `Nanoq` attempts to perform these operations on `fastq` files faster.

Please note that `nanoq` is not a general `fastq` quality control tool because the quality scores are computed for basecalls from nanopore sequencing data as outlined in the [technical documentation](https://community.nanoporetech.com/technical_documents/data-analysis/) and [this issue](https://github.com/esteinig/nanoq/issues/2).

## Usage

### Command line

```
nanoq -f test.fq -l 1000 -q 10 -o filt.fq 
```

### Parameters

```
nanoq 0.0.1

Minimal quality control for nanopore reads

USAGE:
    nanoq [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -f, --fastq <FILE>     Input fastq file [required]
    -l, --length <INT>     Minimum read length [0]
    -o, --output <FILE>    Output fastq file [required]
    -q, --quality <INT>    Minimum read quality [0]
```

### Output

`Nanoq` outputs a a `fastq` file with reads passing the filter and single row of `fastq` summary statistics to `stderr`:

```
5000 29082396 62483 120 5816 2898 11.87 12.02
```

These correspond to:

```
reads bp longest shortest mean_length median_length mean_qscore median_qscore
```

## Etymology

Since all the 'qc' variants of nanopore-themed names seemed to be taken the 'c' was rather lazily dropped. Coincidentally `nanoq` [nan…îq] also means 'polar bear' in Native American (Eskimo-Aleut, Greenlandic). If you find `nanoq` useful for your research consider a small donation to the [Polar Bear Fund](https://www.polarbearfund.ca/) or [Polar Bears International](https://polarbearsinternational.org/).
